# PowerShell Code
 This Repository will hold all of my PowerShellâ€™s script some of these scripts was created as part of homework at Gateway Technical College, some was created as part of personal mini projects.
 
 I recommend checking out my "network-setup.ps1" script, I created it as part of a final project in a class at Gateway Technical College, and it the script I put the most development time into out of all of them.

 I can't promise that all of these scripts will work out of the box.

 I did create some of them with my computer in mind only.
